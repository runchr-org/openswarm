"""Gate-safety invariants for the Phase 2 in-task connect offer (offer_for_gated_server).

The whole point of the offer is that it can ONLY ever suggest, never grant: it must surface a
vetted, inactive, not-dismissed MCP for the user to one-click-connect, and it must never carry
anything that could widen the MCP surface on its own. These tests make a bad offer state fail
loudly instead of shipping a silent gate bypass.
