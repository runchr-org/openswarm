"""
Loop detection for the browser sub-agent.

Tracks recent state-mutating tool calls in a sliding window. If the model
repeats the same (tool, input) with the same result several times, we inject
an is_error message in the next tool_result to force a strategy change. This
prevents the model from burning the entire turn budget on a failing approach.
