"""Handle a complete AssistantMessage envelope from the SDK: split its blocks into thinking /
text / tool-use, fold the thinking into the consolidated pill, surface a friendly card for a
router auth-expiry that arrived as assistant text, and commit the assistant + tool-call messages.
Lifted out of the agent loop; mutates the passed TurnState / ThinkingState by reference and writes
through the manager's live-partial mirror + session registry, exactly as it did inline."""
