"""The always-on openswarm-schedule MCP must never fall through to always_allow:
its committing tools force an approval and Claude's internal Cron* tools are denied,
even when the user set everything to always_allow. This is the unattended-widen guard
the scheduled-tasks PR shipped without a test, and the exact path most at risk in the
agent-manager decomposition (the gating moved from agent_manager into path_gate)."""
