"""Captured per-run state for the SDK tool hooks (can_use_tool / pre / post). Passed by
reference into the extracted hook functions so they can mutate the shared counters without
living inside the agent loop's closure. The session reference is the SAME object the loop
holds (pydantic keeps the instance, doesn't copy it), so hook-side mutations to status /
pending_approvals are visible to the loop."""
