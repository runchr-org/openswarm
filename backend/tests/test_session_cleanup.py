"""Invariant: closing or deleting a session must strand NO per-session state.

The orchestration core keeps several maps keyed by session id (the session
record, its asyncio task, the live partial-stream mirror, and two module-level
view-builder retry/dirty structures). Removal used to pop only `sessions` +
`tasks`, leaking the rest for the life of the process, an unbounded creep over
a long-running app. `_purge_session_memory` is the single chokepoint both the
close and delete paths route through; this pins the invariant that after it
runs the id is gone from EVERY structure, while a sibling session is untouched.

Run with:  backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_session_cleanup.py
