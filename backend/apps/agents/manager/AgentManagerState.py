"""Typing-only contract shared by the AgentManager mixins.

The AgentManager god-object was decomposed into behavior mixins (MessagingMixin,
SessionLifecycleMixin, ...) that read state set in AgentManager.__init__ and call
methods implemented on sibling mixins. From inside one mixin a type checker can't
see that composed surface, so it flags self.sessions / self.run_agent_loop as
unknown. This base declares that surface (the __init__ state + the cross-mixin
methods) so each mixin inherits a typed view of the whole. It carries NO runtime
behavior: the attribute lines are bare annotations (lazy via __future__) and the
methods live in a TYPE_CHECKING block, so at runtime this is an empty class that
just sits once in the MRO. Re-enables the linter's pyright reportAttributeAccessIssue.
